12)what is IOC control ?
Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design principle where the control of object creation and dependency management is delegated to a container or framework, instead of being handled manually in your code.

The IoC Container (like Spring) creates objects, resolves their dependencies, and manages their lifecycle.
Developers declare dependencies (e.g., using annotations like @Autowired) instead of creating objects with new.
IoC promotes loose coupling between components by following the Dependency Injection principle.


13)spring bean - lifeCycle
   *Container gets started.
   *Container creates the objec of bean as per request.
   *Dependencies is created
   *Dependencies is injected
   
   
Bean Lifecycle Stages
Bean Instantiation
The Spring container creates an instance of the bean using its constructor or factory method.

Dependency Injection (Populating Properties)
The container injects dependencies specified (e.g., via @Autowired, XML, or Java config).

Bean Initialization

Spring calls lifecycle callbacks like @PostConstruct or a custom init-method.
Additional logic (e.g., initializing resources) can be executed here.
Bean Usage
The bean is ready to be used in the application.

Bean Destruction

When the container shuts down, it performs cleanup by calling @PreDestroy or a custom destroy-method.
Useful for releasing resources (e.g., closing files or database connections).


14)What is bean factory, have you used XMLBeanFactory ?
this is root interface for accessing a spring bean container.
it is the actual container instantiates, configures, and manages a numb of beans.

XMLBeanFactory
XmlBeanFactory is a deprecated implementation of BeanFactory used to create beans from an XML configuration file. It was used primarily in earlier versions of Spring (before ApplicationContext became the standard).

Why Deprecated?
It lacks advanced features like event propagation, annotation-based configuration, or AOP.
Replaced by ApplicationContext, which is more versatile and widely used.
