12)what is IOC control ?
Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design principle where the control of object creation and dependency management is delegated to a container or framework, instead of being handled manually in your code.

The IoC Container (like Spring) creates objects, resolves their dependencies, and manages their lifecycle.
Developers declare dependencies (e.g., using annotations like @Autowired) instead of creating objects with new.
IoC promotes loose coupling between components by following the Dependency Injection principle.


13)spring bean - lifeCycle
   *Container gets started.
   *Container creates the objec of bean as per request.
   *Dependencies is created
   *Dependencies is injected
   
   
Bean Lifecycle Stages
Bean Instantiation
The Spring container creates an instance of the bean using its constructor or factory method.

Dependency Injection (Populating Properties)
The container injects dependencies specified (e.g., via @Autowired, XML, or Java config).

Bean Initialization

Spring calls lifecycle callbacks like @PostConstruct or a custom init-method.
Additional logic (e.g., initializing resources) can be executed here.
Bean Usage
The bean is ready to be used in the application.

Bean Destruction

When the container shuts down, it performs cleanup by calling @PreDestroy or a custom destroy-method.
Useful for releasing resources (e.g., closing files or database connections).


14)What is bean factory, have you used XMLBeanFactory ?
this is root interface for accessing a spring bean container.
it is the actual container instantiates, configures, and manages a numb of beans.

XMLBeanFactory
XmlBeanFactory is a deprecated implementation of BeanFactory used to create beans from an XML configuration file. It was used primarily in earlier versions of Spring (before ApplicationContext became the standard).

Why Deprecated?
It lacks advanced features like event propagation, annotation-based configuration, or AOP.
Replaced by ApplicationContext, which is more versatile and widely used.

15)difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring
BeanFactory:

Basic container for Spring beans.
Loads beans lazily (creates beans only when they are needed).
Suitable for simple and lightweight applications.
ApplicationContext:

Advanced container with additional features.
Loads beans eagerly (creates all beans during startup unless specified).
Supports additional features like:
Event propagation.
Internationalization.
Annotation-based configurations.
Integration with Spring AOP.
In summary: Use ApplicationContext for most use cases due to its extra capabilities, and BeanFactory for resource-constrained scenarios.


16)difference between Setter Injection and Constructor Injection in Java
Setter Injection:
Uses setter methods to inject dependencies.
Allows partial injection (can set or update values after object creation).
Good for optional or mutable dependencies.

Constructor Injection:
Uses constructors to inject dependencies.
Ensures mandatory dependencies are provided during object creation.
Good for required or immutable dependencies.


17)what are diffrent module in spring ?

1. Core Container
Handles the core functionality of Spring:
Core: Provides the core features like BeanFactory.
Beans: Supports bean creation, configuration, and dependency injection.
Context: Provides application context for enterprise-specific features.
Expression Language (SpEL): Enables querying and manipulation of objects.

2. AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)
Provides support for cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, and transactions.

3. Data Access/Integration
Handles database and messaging integration:
JDBC: Simplifies database operations and error handling.
ORM: Integrates with frameworks like Hibernate and JPA.
JMS: Supports messaging (Java Messaging Service).
Transactions: Manages declarative and programmatic transactions.

4. Web
Used for creating web applications:
Web: Basic web application development.
Web MVC: Framework for MVC-based web applications.
Web WebSocket: Supports WebSocket-based communication.
Web Portlet: For portlet development (optional).

5. Test
Provides testing support, including JUnit and TestNG integration.

6. Other Modules (for advanced functionality):
Security: Authentication and authorization.
Messaging: Integration with messaging systems (e.g., RabbitMQ).
Integration: Provides enterprise integration patterns.
These modules make Spring flexible and suitable for a wide range of applications.



18)diffrence between @autowire and @inject 
@Autowired:
Part of the Spring framework.
Specific to Spring, providing Spring-based dependency injection.

@Inject:
Part of the Java CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) specification in Javax package.
Works with any framework that supports the CDI standard.


19)diffrnce between @Bean @component?
@Bean when you need more control over the bean definition or for third-party classes.
@Component for application-specific classes that can be auto-detected during component


20)what is autowiring in spring ? what are the autowrining modes ?
injecting the beans automatically . we don't need to write explicit injection logic.
no - this is the default mode, it means autowiring is not enabled
byName - injects the bean based on property name. it's use setter method.
byType - based on byType, its used setter
constructor - it injects the bean using constructor

21)different bean scopes in spring ?
Spring provides several bean scopes to define the lifecycle and visibility of beans. These scopes determine how and when a bean instance is created and shared within an application.

Singleton (Default Scope): A single instance of the bean is created for the entire Spring container.
Prototype: A new bean instance is created every time it is requested.
Request (Web applications only): A new bean instance is created for each HTTP request.
Session (Web applications only): A new bean instance is created for each HTTP session.
Application (Web applications only): A single bean instance is created for the entire ServletContext.
WebSocket (WebSocket-enabled applications only): A new bean instance is created for each WebSocket session.
